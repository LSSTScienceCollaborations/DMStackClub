Source Detection
----------------

While source detection in the LSST science pipelines is carried out (first) during the image processing step, there are subsequent detection phases - and, moreover, we are interested in how sources are detected (and how their measured properties depends on that process). See the index table below for links to tutorial notebooks exploring this.
