    "# Deblending with *Scarlet*\n",
    "<br>Owner(s): **Fred Moolekamp** ([@fred3m](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@fred3m))\n",

    "The purpose of this tutorial is to familiarize you with the basics of using *scarlet* to model blended scenes, and how tweaking various objects and parameters affects the resulting model. A tutorial that is more specific to using scarlet in the context of the LSST DM Science Pipelines is also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Configure and run _scarlet_ on a test list of objects;\n",
    "2. Understand its various model assumptions and applied constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attempting this tutorial it will be useful to read the [introduction](http://scarlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_docs.html) to the *scarlet* User Guide, and many of the exercises below may require referencing the *scarlet* [docs](http://scarlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
