# Stack Club Rules

As members of the LSST Science Collaborations' Stack Club, we agree:

1.  **To each maintain the tutorial notebooks that we own.** The owners of each notebook will be written into its top cell, right under the notebook title. Notebooks that fail to run will be flagged as such; issues pointing out broken notebooks can be posted by anyone. 

2. **To code-review other club members' tutorial notebooks when requested.** After approval, a pull requests may be merged by the notebook owner or the Stack Club admins.	

3. **To write high quality tutorial notebooks** following the [Stack Club standards](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/blob/master/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.md#standards). A [template notebook](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/blob/master/GettingStarted/templates/template_Notebook.ipynb) is provided to help with this.

4. **To attend and participate in Stack Club sessions** in order to create and maintain an active learning community.

5. **To give way to others when necessary.** The Stack Club has only a limited number of LSP accounts: if we are not actively developing our Stack Club project, we won't mind if a new member takes our place while our own LSP account is de-activated (possibly temporarily).  

6. **To follow the LSST community guidelines** as laid out at https://community.lsst.org/faq when participating in club sessions and interacting with fellow members on Slack and GitHub, in order to foster an open, inclusive and respectful working environment.
