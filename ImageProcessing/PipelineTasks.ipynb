As an example, we focus on `processCcd.py`, with the goal of diving into the configuration, interface, and structure of pipeline tasks. This notebook is a digression from Justin Myles script that demonstrates how to run a series of pipeline tasks from the command line to rerun HSC data processing [link].\n",
